### DP : greedy + dp

- 以 `[7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]` 为例子

- 其实本题 `dp` 破题点在于:
  - 1. `min` 从 `index 0` 从左往右扫，找出 `min`
  - 2. `maxProfit` 从 `index 1` 从左往右扫，找出 `max`
  - 3. finally, `max - min`, 就可以创造出最大价值！


```py
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # Max profit found so far (start at 0, as no transaction gives 0 profit)
        max_profit = 0
        # Minimum price seen so far (initialize with the first day's price)
        min_price = prices[0]

        # Iterate through prices starting from the second day
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            cur_price = prices[i]

            # Calculate profit if selling today
            potential_profit = cur_price - min_price

            # Update max profit if selling today gives more profit
            max_profit = max(max_profit, potential_profit)

            # Update the minimum price seen so far
            min_price = min(min_price, cur_price)

        # Return the overall maximum profit
        return max_profit
```

### DP


- **allows at most one transaction** (one buy and one sell), you don't need to explicitly track transactions_left (like k=1 in problems with more 
  transactions) in the DP state because the two possible holding_status values are sufficient to implicitly manage the single transaction constraint.
  - 1. **State** dp[i][0] (**Not Holding Stock**):
  - 2. **State** dp[i][1] (**Holding Stock**):



```py
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        dp = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(n)]

        # dp[i][0]: cash on hand at the end of day i, not holding stock
        # dp[i][1]: cash on hand at the end of day i, holding stock

        # Set the base case values for day 0 (index 0)
        dp[0][0] = 0 # not holding stock at end of day 0 -> cash is 0
        dp[0][1] = -prices[0] # holding stock at end of day 0 -> cash is -price of day 0 (bought on day 0)

        for i in range(1, n):
            # Calculate dp[i][0]: Cash at the end of day i, not holding stock
            # Max of:
            # 1. Cash from end of day i-1, not holding (dp[i-1][0]), and skipped transaction today.
            # 2. Cash from end of day i-1, holding (dp[i-1][1]), and sold stock today (+ prices[i]).
            dp[i][0] = max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] + prices[i])

            # Calculate dp[i][1]: Cash at the end of day i, holding stock
            # Max of:
            # 1. Cash from end of day i-1, holding (dp[i-1][1]), and held stock today.
            # 2. Negative of today's price (-prices[i]). (You bought a stock on day i. To do this, you must have not been holding a stock at the end of day i-1).
            dp[i][1] = max(dp[i - 1][1], -prices[i])
            # You were already holding a stock at the end of day i-1 (dp[i - 1][1]),
            # and you continued to hold it on day i. Your cash remains dp[i - 1][1].

        # The final answer is the cash on hand at the end of the last day (index n-1),
        # when not holding stock (dp[n-1][0]), as profit is realized upon selling.
        return dp[n - 1][0]
