## Why does Java use (hash & 0x7FFFFFFF) % tab.length to decide the index of a key?

- What is `0x7FFFFFFF` in binary? It's `01111111 11111111 11111111 11111111`
  - Note that the `leftmost bit` is `0`. That means that the number is **always positive** (Since the 
    `leftmost bit` is zero). Because of the `&`, every number that'll be `&`-ed with this binary will be **non-negative** since:

```ruby
01111111111111111111111111111111
Anything                          &
--------------------------------
0 ‚Üê Always
```

- After this, the `%` operator is used to ensure that we are in the range of `table.length`.
