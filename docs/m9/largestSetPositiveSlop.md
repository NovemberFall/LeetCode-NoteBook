# Largest Set Of Points With Positive Slope

```ruby
Given an array of 2D coordinates of points (all the coordinates are integers), 
find the largest number of points that can form a set such that any pair of points 
in the set can form a line with positive slope. 
Return the size of such a maximal set.

Assumptions

The given array is not null
Note: if there does not even exist 2 points can form a line with positive slope, should return 0.
Examples

<0, 0>, <1, 1>, <2, 3>, <3, 3>, 
the maximum set of points are {<0, 0>, <1, 1>, <2, 3>}, 
the size is 3.
