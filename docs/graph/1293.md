```ruby
        // If k is large enough, the shortest path is just Manhattan distance
        if (k >= m + n - 2) {
            return m + n - 2;
        }
```

- `m + n - 2`: This is the Manhattan distance from the starting cell (0, 0) to the target cell (m-1, n-1). 
  The Manhattan distance is the minimum number of steps required to move from one cell to another in a grid, only moving horizontally or 
  vertically (like on a city grid). 



- why did `boolean[][][] visited = new boolean[m][n][k + 1];` set to be **k + 1** ?
- We use **k + 1** for the **third dimension** of the visited array to represent **all possible counts of obstacle eliminations**, from 
  **0** up to **k**.

- If `k = 2`, that means:
  - You can eliminate **0**, **1**, or **2** obstacles on your path.
  - That's **3 distinct states** (0 to 2 inclusive), so we need indices 0 to k.
