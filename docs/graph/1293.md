```ruby
        // If k is large enough, the shortest path is just Manhattan distance
        if (k >= m + n - 2) {
            return m + n - 2;
        }
```

- `m + n - 2`: This is the Manhattan distance from the starting cell (0, 0) to the target cell (m-1, n-1). 
  The Manhattan distance is the minimum number of steps required to move from one cell to another in a grid, only moving horizontally or 
  vertically (like on a city grid).
