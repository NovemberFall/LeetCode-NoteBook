## Introduction

- [LeetCode Graph](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/graph/)

- Types of “graphs”
  - `undirected graphs`, 
    - The edges between any two vertices in an “undirected graph” do not have a direction, indicating a two-way relationship.
  - `directed graphs`
    - The edges between any two vertices in a “directed graph” graph are directional.

  - `weighted graphs`
    - Each edge in a “weighted graph” has an associated weight. The weight can be of any metric, such as time, distance, size, etc. The most commonly seen “weighted map” in our daily life might be a city map.
