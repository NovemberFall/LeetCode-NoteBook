## 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
![](img/2022-05-22-21-09-41.png)

-  the main idea is that we need to find some parts of array that we could adopt
   binary search on that, which means we need to find some completed sorted parts, 
   then determine whether target is in left part or right part. There is at least one 
   segment (left part or right part) is monotonically increasing.

- If the entire left part is monotonically increasing, which means the pivot point is 
  on the right part
  - If left <= target < mid ------> drop the right half
  - Else ------> drop the left half
- If the entire right part is monotonically increasing, which means the pivot point 
  is on the left part
  - If mid < target <= right ------> drop the left half
  - Else ------> drop the right half

```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return -1;
        }

        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (target == nums[mid]) {
                return mid;
            }
            if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {

                if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
                else {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            else {
                if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
                else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
