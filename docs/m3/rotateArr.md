## 189. Rotate Array

```ruby
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]


Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

Follow up:

Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. 
There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?


nums = "----->-->"; k =3
result = "-->----->";

reverse "----->-->" we can get "<--<-----"
reverse "<--" we can get "--><-----"
reverse "<-----" we can get "-->----->"
```

```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (k == 0) {
            return;
        }
        int len = nums.length;
        k %= len;
        reverse(nums, 0, len-1);
        reverse(nums, 0, k-1);
        reverse(nums, k, len-1);
    }
    
    private void reverse(int[] arr, int left, int right) {
        while(left < right){
            int temp = arr[left];
            arr[left] = arr[right];
            arr[right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
}
```
