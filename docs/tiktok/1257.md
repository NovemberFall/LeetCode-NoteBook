## 1257. Smallest Common Region
![](img/2024-06-29-22-27-23.png)
---

- a region **X contains itself**.

```java
/**
    The idea is very simple here. We need to get one of the region and its ancestors in a set and 
    then check if region2 or its any of the parent or ancestor is present in the set. 
    If we find a match then that is the smallest common region between region1 and region2.
    
    Follwing are the steps:
    1. Get the map of child-parent, Key = child, Value = parent
        This will make our life easier as iterating a map is easy than a bunch of lists
    2. We have to keep adding region1, its parent, grandparent, etc. in a set till it doesn't become null
    3. Now keep checking for region2 or its parents/ancestors in a set
    4. Wherever we find a match, that is our answer!
