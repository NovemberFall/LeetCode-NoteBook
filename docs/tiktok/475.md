## 475. Heaters

---

- An array `houses`, representing the positions of houses.
- An array `heaters`, representing the positions of heaters.


- **Goal**: Find the **minimum** radius such that every house is **within the range of at least one heater**.
  Each heater covers a **radius**, so a heater at position `h` can warm any house between `[h - radius, h + radius]`.
  You need to return the **smallest possible radius** that works for all houses.

#### Steps:
- 1. **Sort** the heaters array so you can perform **binary search** on it.
- 2. For **each house**, find the **closest heater(s)** to it:
  - Use binary search to find the **rightmost heater <= house**.
  - Check both that heater and the next one (if it exists).
- 3. Compute the **distance from the house to both nearby heaters**, and take the smaller one.
- 4. The **maximum** of these distances (over all houses) is the **radius you need**.
